### Initial thoughts

so it seems that we are going to need some data services. yay!
I am going to be packaging the main tooling as a lib and try to import and use it in the notebook.
also I wish I could add the static checks to this env and repo setup, but maybe later.

so going back to the price service, we have some rest api to hit it seems.
we are going to establish an service interface, and API impelementation, and a service wrapper.
and some data types as contract.
